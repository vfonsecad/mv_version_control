\section{Materials and Methods}


For this workshop we used a repository containing a data analysis project. We used python to simulate some data, perform an exploratory analysis and fitted a simple linear regression model. We used the python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn. The structure of the repository is organized in a way that the data analysis can be run and the output goes directly to the report folder. The report file is written in latex and each section is separated so that they can all be modified individually and then merged together in a single report file
