# Welcome to this repo!
### This is the repo for the Git free workshop taught by me and @vfonsecad

We will add the people that have filled the google form as collaborators to this repository for the hands-on session of our workshop.

If you accepted the collaboration invite, then you are **ready-to-go** for the session!

Please go to the Issues page and pick up a task of your interest

If something is not working, or you are not sure what to do, no worries! Reach out to us with your questions during the sessions or contact us by e-mail.  valeria.fonseca.diaz@gmail.com or marcodv93@gmail.com
