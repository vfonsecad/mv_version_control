== What is version control?
The Lifeâ€‘Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Marie Kondo

- Most robust paradigm for project developement: structure and organization management
- System that allows to effectively track changes and merge files
- It allows to connect project developers
- Projects can now live in many different places at the same time without conflict: locally (your computer folder) and remotely
- Version control is explained, applied and mostly discussed in the context of software development, but it can be used in the development of any well-structured digital project: e.g. collaborative reports, academic publications, etc.
