== Basic Workflow


How can we properly and cleanly work with Git?

*Time to try out!*

=== Start a repository: basic jargon

[.unorderedlist]
--
* *Repository (repo):* project directory (project folder). This directory is version-controlled
* *Local repo:* the version of the repository that lives in a local machine
* *Remote repo:* the version of the repository that lives in a remote machine or server
--

=== Start a repository

Either **clone** an existing remote repository or **create** a new one locally and push it remotely

=== While working on the project: basic jargon

[.unorderedlist]
--
* *Fetch*: download remote history to your local repository to *see* what others have done.
* *Branch*: a pointer that tracks a version of the repo. Several branches can be created to develop separately different parts of the project which can later be merged to a main branch. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell[See here more details]
* *Pull*: download remote branch to your local branch to *integrate* what others have done. _(pull = fetch + merge)_
* *Commit*: a documented checkpoint of the status of the repository
* *Push*: send local repository branch to remote repository branch

=== While working on the project

//**Fetch** new information to see what changed remotely; *pull* remote branch into local branch if existing or create a **branch** for every feature you work on; *checkout* to the branch; work and **add** the modified files, then **commit** those changes; finally **push** the local branch to the remote branch

=== Merging: basic jargon

[.unorderedlist]
--
* *Merge*: *integrate* one branch into another branch
* *Merge conflict*: an inconsistency between 2 branches that were merged. Same files have different changes at the same locations or lines. When a merge conflict occurs, *solve the conflict*, *add* and *commit*.

When you are done with a feature, **merge** the branch back with main
