== Why version control?
Has this ever happened to you?

=== Illustrating problematic workflow
*The project is the production of a report and you take the initiative to start it.*

_Natural instinct_ : create the first version naming it "v1".

*You send it to Ana and Bob for their parts and revision, while you also keep working on it.*

_Natural instinct_ : Ana and Bob work on their part and name it something different.

The project now exists in *3 different versions*!

All of them at _different stages_ of progress.

You or someone else has to put them *all together manually*!

=== Now what?: A better approach

[.unorderedlist]
--
* Define and design project with *structure*: which _parts_ and how they _interact_
* Avoid thousands of *versions* and their storage for the same file(s)
* *Document changes* as the files are built and _go back_ to previous versions
* *Collaborate effectively* with other people when making projects
