=== Now what?: A better approach

[.unorderedlist]
--
* Define and design project with structure: parts and how they interact
* Finally avoid thousands of versions and their storage for the same file(s)
* Document changes as the files are built so you know what you've done and can go back to previous versions
* We're never really working alone. Collaborate effectively with other people when making projects
