== Why version control?
Has this ever happened to you?

[%notitle]
=== Illustrating problematic workflow
The project is the production of a report and you start it

Natural instinct : create the first version naming it "v1"

=== Illustrating problematic workflow
You send it to Ana and Bob for their parts and revision, while you keep working on it also

Natural instinct : Ana and Bob produce their part and name it accordingly to avoid confusion

The project now exists in 3 different versions, probably all of them at different stages of progress

=== Now what?: A better approach
- Define and design project with structure: parts and how they interact
- Finally avoid thousands of versions and their storage for the same file(s)
- Document changes as the files are built so you know what you've done and can go back to previous versions
- We're never really working alone. Collaborate effectively with other people when making projects
