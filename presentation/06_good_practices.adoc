* *Create effective branches*: what feature? which contributor?
* Before you start working: git fetch and git pull/merge to *work on the last version*
* *Commit frequently and descriptively*, then push accordingly
* Forgot what you are doing? Check git status to *display in which stage you are*
* Something unexpected? Check git log to *revise the commit history*
