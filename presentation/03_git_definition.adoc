=== Git

Git can be used as a version control system to manage your projects in their local and remote versions

The remote manager provides the interface to use Git (e.g. Github provides a user friendly interface to commit, merge, etc.)

To manage the local version of your repository, you can use Git through a command window or rely on Git user friendly interfaces

=== Version control Git basic jargon
- Repository (repo): project directory (project folder). This directory is version-controlled
- Local repo: the version of the repository that lives in a local machine
- Remote repo: the version of the repository that lives in a remote machine or server

- Commit: a documented checkpoint of the status of the repository
- Branch: a pointer that tracks a version of the repo. Several branches can be created to develop separately different parts of the project which can later be merged to a main branch. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell[See here more details]

- Push: send local repository branch to remote repository branch
- Pull: receive remote repository branch into local repository branch
