# Version Control Training Basic Tools

This is the material to teach the fundamental tools about Git and introduction to Github.

The presentation can be found in the presentation folder and the material for the workshop in the workshop folder. The presentation can be found in the [gh-pages branch](https://vfonsecad.github.io/mv_version_control/index.html#/)

We currently host this basic workshop folder but during the workshop we create and work on another repository.
